# Advanced Trivia Homework Assignment

I went with the advanced version of the homework. The theme is San Francisco Giants. I had a to finish a huge project for and travel for work, so I didn't have a lot of time to work on the CSS. I used for Bootstrap for this assignment. The JS is a mixture of vanilla and jQuery.
